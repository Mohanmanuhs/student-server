# Student Server

This is a server application built using IntelliJ IDEA and the Ktor framework. It provides REST API endpoints for fetching, updating, deleting, and adding data to a MySQL database. The server utilizes various modern technologies including DataStore, Koin for dependency injection, Ktor client for networking with REST API, Coroutines for asynchronous programming, and JSON serialization for data handling.

## Technologies Used

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The primary IDE for server-side Kotlin development.
- **Koin Dependency Injection**: A lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- **Ktor Client**: An asynchronous networking framework for Kotlin and Android.
- **REST API**: Utilized for communication with clients and handling CRUD operations.
- **MySQL Database**: Used for persistent data storage.
- **Coroutines**: Kotlin's native approach to asynchronous programming.
- **Ktor Framework**: A Kotlin-based asynchronous web framework.
- **JSON Serialization**: For handling JSON data in the server.
